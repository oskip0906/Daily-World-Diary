Dear Diary,

Today has been a day filled with both natural disasters and political tensions. The devastating storm, known as Mediterranean storm Daniel, wreaked havoc in eastern Libya, causing deadly flooding in several towns. However, the city of Derna suffered the most, with two dams collapsing and unleashing a torrent of floodwaters that swept away entire city blocks. The death toll in Derna alone has reached a tragic count of at least 5,100 people, while around 100 others lost their lives in various parts of eastern Libya. The storm also affected other towns, such as Bayda, Susa, and Marj, washing parts of them away into the sea. It is a heartbreaking tragedy, and the Libyan people are not only grieving but also expressing anger at the rival governments that have prioritized their own interests rather than the needs of their citizens.

In a painful editorial by The Guardian, the floods in Libya are characterized as not only a natural disaster but a man-made catastrophe. Corruption, lack of infrastructure maintenance, impunity, and the suppression of civil society have all contributed to this disaster. The article highlights the urgent need for a system change that prioritizes the well-being of the Libyan people and addresses the underlying problems that exacerbate the impact of natural disasters. Whether or not climate change played a role in the intensity of Storm Daniel remains uncertain, but the neglect and pillaging of essential infrastructure have undoubtedly worsened its devastating consequences. The article raises a crucial question: Will the international community now come forward to assist ordinary Libyans in rebuilding their lives?

Meanwhile, preparations are underway in Nova Scotia as Hurricane Lee approaches. The utility company is activating its emergency operations center and working in collaboration with contractors and the community to ensure the safety and well-being of the people. Both the Red Cross and Emergency Management Office (EMO) recommend that individuals have emergency kits stocked with essential supplies for at least 72 hours. The diligent preparations and proactive measures reflect the dedication of the authorities to protect their communities from the potential impacts of this approaching storm.

In a different part of the world, the tensions between Russia and the West have been further strained by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's support for Russia. The US Department of State expressed concern over the possibility of increased cooperation between Russia and North Korea, highlighting that such collaboration could violate UN Security Council resolutions. The United Kingdom also called for an end to arms talks between North Korea and Russia, citing the need to respect the international sanctions regime. As the diplomatic tensions escalate, it is interesting to note that Kim Jong Un has chosen Russian President Vladimir Putin as his first foreign meeting since the pandemic began, underscoring the shifting geopolitical dynamics in the region.

Today has been filled with both tragedy and political turmoil. The world witnessed the devastating impact of a natural disaster in Libya, caused not only by a storm but also by the failures of governance and infrastructure. On the other side of the globe, tensions between Russia, North Korea, and the West continue to escalate. It is a reminder that while nature's forces can be powerful, the actions of humans can also shape the course of events. May we learn from these events and work towards building a more resilient and compassionate world.

Yours sincerely,
