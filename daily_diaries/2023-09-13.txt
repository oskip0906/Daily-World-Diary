Dear Diary,

Today, I received distressing news about the devastating storm and flooding that hit eastern Libya. The destruction caused by this natural disaster has led to the death or disappearance of more than 10,000 people. It breaks my heart to witness the loss of so many lives and the immense pain experienced by the residents of Libya.

Mediterranean storm Daniel unleashed its fury on multiple coastal towns, but Derna, a city located in eastern Libya, bore the brunt of its wrath. The storm caused dams to burst, leading to massive floods that swept away entire neighborhoods and left the city in ruins.

The lack of flood warnings in a country already torn between rival governments has sparked widespread anger among the Libyan people. It is disheartening to witness the destruction and loss of life that could have potentially been avoided with better preparedness and warning systems in place.

The city of Derna, with a population of about 100,000, suffered greatly, with a quarter of its population now displaced and their homes destroyed. The damage caused by the floods has made it difficult for international rescue teams and humanitarian aid to reach the affected areas promptly, exacerbating the already dire situation.

Emergency aid has started to arrive from multiple countries, including Egypt, Turkey, Italy, and Algeria. However, it is clear that the scale of this disaster will require a sustained and coordinated international effort to address the immediate needs of the affected population and aid in their recovery.

The consequences of this tragedy extend beyond the loss of life and the destruction of infrastructure. They reflect the ongoing challenges faced by Libya, a country that has endured years of conflict, poverty, and displacement. The limited aid and shrinking humanitarian response in recent years further highlight the need for increased support and solidarity with the Libyan people during their time of need.

As I reflect on the events unfolding in Libya, I am reminded of the importance of preparedness, resilience, and international cooperation when faced with natural disasters. It is my hope that lessons will be learned from this tragedy and that measures will be taken to enhance disaster management and response capabilities in Libya and around the world.

Today, my thoughts and prayers are with the people of Libya as they mourn their losses and embark on the challenging task of rebuilding their lives and communities. May they find the strength to overcome this tragedy and emerge stronger than ever before.

Yours sincerely,
